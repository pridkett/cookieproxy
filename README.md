# CookieProxy

## Overview

This was made for a _very_ niche use case of needing to use [telegraf](telegraf) with a remote API that required cookies and non-standard authentication method to get those cookies. Using this tool you can proxy through those requests with the appropriate cookies.

## Usage

While CookieProxy works without a CookieJar, you'll first want to create a CookieJar for maximum awesomeness.

```bash
./cookieproxy -cookiejar ~/cookies.txt
```

You'll see that CookieProxy has started on port 8675 and is ready to proxy requests:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8675/p/?target=http://foo.com/bar.png
```
